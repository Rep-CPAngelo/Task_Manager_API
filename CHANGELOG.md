- Integrated WebSocket server setup in `server.js` with HTTP server upgrade and proper initialization
- Implemented JWT-based WebSocket authentication middleware with user validation and connection management
- Added real-time task update events in `services/taskService.js` for create/update/delete/status/comment operations
- Integrated live board synchronization in `services/boardService.js` for column operations and task movements
- Enhanced notification system in `services/notificationService.js` with instant WebSocket broadcasting
- Created comprehensive WebSocket API documentation in `docs/WEBSOCKET_API.md` with connection setup, event handling, and client examples
- Updated `docs/API_EXAMPLES.md` with extensive real-time integration examples for React, React Native, and mobile development
- Added typing indicators, room subscriptions (tasks/boards), and user presence management
- Implemented connection cleanup, error handling, and performance optimizations for scalable real-time features
- Updated `docs/TASKS.md` with Milestone 6 planning for real-time features and production readiness

Commit: feat: Comprehensive performance testing infrastructure with monitoring and benchmarking

Changes:
- Created performance monitoring middleware in `middleware/performanceMonitor.js` with real-time metrics collection
- Built database benchmark suite in `performance/database-benchmark.js` testing 685 operations across users, tasks, boards, and analytics
- Implemented comprehensive API testing framework in `performance/comprehensive-test.js` with authentication, stress testing, and detailed reporting
- Added Artillery load testing configuration in `performance/artillery-config.yml` with warm-up, ramp-up, sustained, and spike testing phases
- Created performance API endpoints in `routes/performance.js` for admin monitoring, health checks, and benchmark recommendations
- Built automated test data generator in `performance/setup-test-data.js` creating 800 tasks, 50 boards, and 10 users for realistic testing
- Added performance NPM scripts: `perf:setup`, `perf:benchmark`, `perf:comprehensive`, `perf:load`, `perf:quick`, `perf:all`
- Created comprehensive performance documentation in `docs/PERFORMANCE_TESTING.md` with benchmarks, recommendations, and testing procedures
- Updated OpenAPI specification in `docs/openapi.json` with complete performance API schemas (PerformanceMetrics, PerformanceHealth, BenchmarkRecommendations)
- Established performance baselines: 42.76ms average response time, 23.4 ops/sec, 0% error rate
- Identified key optimization opportunities: user creation bottleneck (411ms), MongoDB connectivity improvements, rate limiting adjustments

Commit: feat: Milestone 4 (comments, attachments, subtasks, activity); Swagger UI; Postman flows; in-memory test DB

Changes:
- Added `models/TaskActivity.js` and activity logging in `controllers/taskController.js` for actions: create/update/delete/status, comment, attachment, subtask add/update; added `GET /api/tasks/:id/activity` with pagination.
- Extended Task endpoints: `POST /:id/comments`, `POST /:id/attachments`, `POST /:id/subtasks`, `PATCH /:id/subtasks/:subId`; updated validations in `validations/taskSchemas.js`.
- Enabled `_id` on subtasks in `models/Task.js` to support subtask updates.
- Expanded `docs/openapi.json` with full schemas, request/response models, examples, pagination params; mounted Swagger UI at `/api/docs` via `swagger-ui-express`.
- Updated Postman collection to capture `accessToken`/`refreshToken`, auto-store `task_id` and `subtask_id`, and added new task endpoints and auth token flows (refresh/logout).
- Improved tests: added `tests/tasks.test.js` for Task CRUD, comments, attachments, subtasks, and activity; standardized to use `mongodb-memory-server` in `tests/setup.js`.
- README updated with Tasks section, Swagger docs link, and Postman usage instructions.
- Note: Mongoose warning about duplicate TTL index on `RefreshToken.expiresAt`; consider removing the field-level `index: true` and keep TTL index only.

Commit: feat: Quick wins - database indexes, OpenAPI completion

Changes:
- Added unique database index on `users.email` in `models/User.js` for database-level constraint enforcement.
- Completed OpenAPI documentation in `docs/openapi.json` with missing schemas: `LoginResponse`, `SuccessResponseTask`, `PaginatedTaskResponse`, `PaginatedActivityResponse`.
- Added missing endpoint documentation for Health and Users endpoints with proper request/response schemas and error responses.
- All referenced schemas now properly defined with examples and validation rules.

Commit: feat: DB & Performance optimizations - composite indexes and lean queries

Changes:
- Added composite indexes in `models/Task.js` for common filter combinations: `{ isDeleted, createdBy, createdAt }`, `{ isDeleted, assignedTo, createdAt }`, `{ isDeleted, status, createdAt }`, `{ isDeleted, priority, createdAt }`, `{ isDeleted, dueDate, createdAt }`, `{ isDeleted, createdBy, status }`, `{ isDeleted, assignedTo, status }`.
- Applied `.lean()` optimization to list endpoints in `controllers/taskController.js` and `controllers/userController.js` for improved performance when serialization of Mongoose documents is not required.
- Optimized queries in `getTasks()`, `getActivity()`, `getAllUsers()`, and `searchUsers()` methods for better performance and reduced memory usage.
